/**
 * $brandy-dark-text
 * $brandy-light-text
 *
 * Sets the dark and light color values for the color-contrast() @function.
 * The dark color will be returned when contrasting against light backgrounds,
 * and the light color will be returned when contrasting against dark
 * backgrounds. Note, the color() @function will attempt to contrast
 * foreground and background colors according to WebAIM accessibility standards.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-bg-contrast
 *
 * Set the color-contrast() @function to use the given background color
 * to generate dark and light color values. Setting this to TRUE tells
 * the color-contrast() @function to ignore the above values. Setting
 * this to FALSE will tell the color-contrast() @function to use the above
 * variables instead. Note, the light and dark colors generated will be a
 * shade and tint of the input background color, respectively.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-colors-map
 *
 * Sets the default map to be used for the color() @function. This value
 * can be set equal to a map or a variable which references a map. The sample
 * syntax for an appropriate color map is given below:
 *
 * $colors: (
 *  '<color-name>': (
 *    base: <color-value>,
 *    <tone>: <color-variant>,
 *    <tone-map>: (
 *      '<tone-amont>': <tone-variant>,
 *      ...
 *    ),
 *    ...
 *  ),
 *  ...
 *);
 *
 * In the example above, <color-name> and base: <color-value> are
 * **required**. Additional tones can be added using the <tone>:
 * <color-variant> format, or a tone map can be added using the
 * <tone-map> syntax.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-fonts-map
 *
 * Sets the default map to be used for the font() @function. This value
 * can be set equal to a map or a variable which references a map. The sample
 * syntax for an appropriate font map is given below:
 *
 * $fonts: (
 *  '<font-name-major>': <font-family>,
 *  '<font-name-major>': (
 *    '<font-name-minor>': <font-family>,
 *    ...
 *  ),
 *  ...
 *);
 *
 * In the example above, <font-name-major> is the base font name.
 * Both <font-name-major> and <font-family> are **required**. Additionally,
 * <font-name-minor> gives an example of how nested maps are handled
 * within the font map. The font map can be nested as deep as desired.
 * Deeply nested font maps are referenced by <font-name-major> followed by
 * all subsequent <font-name-minor> values, where each major and minor value
 * should be its own string separated by a space.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-screens-map
 *
 * Sets the default map to be used for the screen() @function. This value
 * can be set equal to a map or a variable which references a map. The sample
 * syntax for an appropriate screen map is given below:
 *
 * $screens: (
 *  '<screen-name>': <screen-setting>,
 *  ...
 *);
 *
 * In the example above, <screen-name> and <screen-setting> are **required**.
 * If using [Breakpoint](breakpoint-sass.com), <screen-setting> should be
 * used for the Breakpoint configuration, and <screen-name> should be a memorable
 * name that can be used with the screen() @function. Usage would then look like:
 *
 * @include breakpoint( screen(<screen-name>) ){ ... }
 */
/**
 * $brandy-scale-map
 *
 * Sets the default map to be used for the scale-font() @function. This value
 * can be set equal to a map or a variable which references a map. The sample
 * syntax for an appropriate scale map is given below:
 *
 * $scale: (
 *  '<screen-name>': <screen-scale>,
 *  ...
 *);
 *
 * In the example above, <screen-name> and <screen-setting> are **required**.
 * There should be one <screen-name> key with its corresponding <screen-scale>
 * value to represent each key-value pair in the $brandy-screens-map above.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-scale-responsive
 *
 * Signals to the scale-font() @function whether or not font scaling should also
 * be responsive. If set to TRUE, fonts will be scaled according to the values in
 * the $font-scale-map variable above for each screen breakpoint in the
 * $brandy-screens-map. If set to FALSE, no scaling will occur.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-scale-increasing
 *
 * Signals to the scale-font() @function to proportionately increase or
 * decrease the font size for the given elements. If set to TRUE, font size
 * will increase from the first element in the list through the last 
 * element. If set to FALSE, the reverse effect will occur.
 */
/** 
 * $brandy-scale-max
 * $brandy-scale-min
 *
 * Sets the maximum and minimum font size for the scale-font() @function.
 * The maximum font size is applied to the first element in the element list
 * and the minimum font size is applied to the last element if 
 * $brandy-scale-increasing above is set to TRUE. If the above variable is
 * set to FALSE, the reverse effect will occur. If no maximum value is given,
 * then the minimum value will also be used as the maximum. The minimum value
 * is always **required**.
 */
/**
 * $brandy-config-map
 *
 * Sets the default map to be used for the config() @function. This value
 * can be set equal to a map or a variable which references a map. The sample
 * syntax for an appropriate config map is given below:
 *
 * $config: (
 *  '<config-name>': <config-setting>,
 *  ...
 *);
 *
 * In the example above, <config-name> and <config-settings> are **required**.
 * This config map can be nested as deep as desired. When using deeply nested
 * config maps, the <config-name> should be followed by any subsequent map key
 * names until the desired depth is reached, where the <config-name> and all map
 * keys are their own strings separated by spaces.

/**
 * $brandy-grid-columns
 * $brandy-grid-rows
 * $brandy-grid-gutter
 * $brandy-grid-name
 * $brandy-grid-items
 * $brandy-grid-units
 *
 * Defines the default grid layout used by Brandy for the grid() @mixin. This 
 * grid layout can be overridden at the global level by resetting these 
 * variables, or instance-specific variables can be fed into the grid() @function.
